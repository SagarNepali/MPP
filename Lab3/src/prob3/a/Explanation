It does not makes sense to use inheritance here as the practical approach of circle is not completed. Height is irrelevant for Circle.
Also, we use inheritance for polymorphism but we cannot achieve dynamic binding if we create a Parent reference with Child Object, we cannot even call
the only method of Circle which is compute area.
