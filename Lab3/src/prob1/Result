Person p1 = new PersonWithJob("Joe",3000);
Person p2 = new Person("Joe");

Here, p1.equals(p2) is false as p1 is the reference of Child class i.e PersonWithJob and it has overridden the equals method
and has applied both name and salary to be equal so that the object can be equal.

In second, p2.equals(p1) is true as p2 is the object of Person class and in its equals method, only the name is checked to be equal
so that the objects can be said as equal.
